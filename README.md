# todo-list
A simple project to get used to working with Vue.js

## Idea
I wanted to make a checklist app with some basic features.
### Features
I went in with three things I wanted to accomplish:
1. Be able to add and remove items, additionally items should be able to be marked off when done
2. Add notes to each item. If a task was long one could add notes on what was done or even sup tasks
    I wanted to have a way to categorize each item so sub tasks would be easier to create but that idea fell short
3. Give each task some sort of priority. This would be accomplished by giving each task a color.

## Wants and What Could be Improved
I want to add a settings tab or page so that the color could be more customizable.
Additionally I feel like the overall design is rough. I could spend more time on the CSS but I feel the UI is fine for what it is.
